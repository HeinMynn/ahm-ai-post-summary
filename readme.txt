= Do I need an API key? =

Yes, you'll need either a Google Gemini API key or an OpenAI API key. The plugin provides detailed instructions on how to get these for free.

= Which AI provider should I choose? =

We recommend Google Gemini as it offers a generous free tier and faster response times. However, both providers work excellently.

= Are API keys secure? =

Yes, API keys are stored securely in your WordPress database and are never exposed to website visitors or included in any frontend code.

= How do I know if my API key is working? =

The plugin now includes a "Validate API Key" button that appears when you enter an API key. Click it to test your key in real-time and get immediate feedback on whether it's working correctly.

Yes! Each post now has a "Regenerate Summary" button in the post editor. Click it to instantly generate a new summary with your current settings.

= Why am I getting API errors? =

The plugin provides detailed error messages to help troubleshoot:
- **Invalid API key**: Check your key format and permissions

= Can I customize the summary appearance? =

Yes, the summaries use CSS classes that you can style in your theme. The default styling is clean and responsive.
